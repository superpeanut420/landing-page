                <div class="border"><img src="hay.jpg" alt="hay and pig"></div>
                <p>A classic! Pigs love to use hay as a resting spot, play area, 
                    but also as a quick snack. Having a supply of hay on hand 
                    is necessary to raising your own guinea pig!

            <div class="box2">
                <div class="border"><img src="kiwi.jpg" alt="kiwi and pig"></div>
                <p>Flipping sweet and epic! For pigs kiwi is a very safe,
                    healthy, and tasty treat. They are ussually very cheap 
                    in the supermarket, and it is just so cute how they 
                    chomp on this fruit :D

            <div class="box3">
                <div class="border"><img src="celery.jpg" alt="celery and pig"></div>
                <p>Holy crap its the main character from Veggie Tales! 
                    Packed with a massive crunch, celery is a super healthy 
                    snack for guinea pigs. I ussually give mine a stalk everyday!
                </p>

            <div class="box4">
                <div class="border"><img src="carrot.webp" alt="carrot and pig"></div>
                <p>Unlock your pig's super vision! Carrots are perhaps the healthiest 
                    option out of all of these foods due to its high fiber which 
                    keeps your pet strong and healthy.
